# Mercenaries of Astonia v2 client - modified
Original code found at https://brockhaus.org/merc2.html. You will need to download the packaged graphic files from this site for the client to work properly.

You also need to move the images from gfx/overlays/ back into the gfx folder.

**IMPORTANT:** this repo is deprecated. You can find an updated version (along with the server) over at: https://github.com/AbAeterno8445/astoniav2-abmods
